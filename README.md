### Introduction
This repository is for our IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) 2021 paper '[A Rotation-Invariant Framework for Deep Point Cloud Analysis]'. In this paper, we introduce a new low-level purely rotation-invariant representation to replace common 3D Cartesian coordinates as the network inputs. Also, we present a network architecture to embed these representations into features, encoding local relations between points and their neighbors, and the global shape structure. To alleviate inevitable global information loss caused by the rotation-invariant representations, we further introduce a region relation convolution to encode local and non-local information. We evaluate our method on multiple point cloud analysis tasks, including (i) shape classification, (ii) part segmentation, and (iii) shape retrieval. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves consistent, and also the best performance, on inputs at arbitrary orientations, compared with all the state-of-the-art methods.

### Usage
The code will be released soon.
